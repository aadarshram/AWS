# Automatic Waste Segregator - Image Classification Model

This project is a part of my Deputy Coordinator tenure from November, 2023 to May, 2024 in Sahaay Social Innovation Club at IIT Madras.

## Objective


The objective is to design an image classification system using pre-trained MobileNet architecture which is capable of automatically sorting waste items into six distinct classes based on their material type: glass, metal, paper, wood, plastic and mixed. The 'mixed' class also holds other types of waste. The ultimate goal is to integrate this into a physical waste bin system in an effort to improve recycling efficiency and waste management.

## Dataset

Used a dataset of 5327 images with a train/val/test split of 70/15/15

## Results:

Train Accuracy: 0.9447572827339172

Validation Accuracy: 0.9884687662124634

Validation F1 Score (macro): 0.9838134895955094

Test Accuracy: 0.84

Test F1 Score (macro): 0.8339493856287788


A good balance between high accuracy and high F1 score was obtained.
